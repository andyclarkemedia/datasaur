					Stuart recently signed a lease on a stationary coffee van in Edinburgh. He's right next to the University and is targeting the morning and lunchtime coffee rush from students at the Library round the corner.  
				</p>
				<p id="p-2">
					Stuart's business, Uplands Roast, controls the whole process of taking coffee beans from the farm to the cup. He is optimistic about his prospects and passionate about building a sustainable and environmentally friendly business.
				</p>
				<p id="p-3">
					Stuart directly trades with a speciality coffee farmer in Da Lat, Vietnam. For these beans he pays £18.70 p/kg in comparison to the mean price of £8.80 p/kg for importing coffee to the UK from Vietnam. He believes in paying more for the best coffee and that this money should all go to the farmer.

					Stuart uses around 20 pints of milk per day. He buys this from a local supplier that delivers milk in glass bottles for £1.00 per pint of milk. The supplier will then collect and reuse the bottles. His alternative is to fetch his milk in plastic containers from the local supermarket for 40p per pint. 
				</p>
				<p id="p-5">
					Another significant overhead for Stuart is the price of coffee cups. It costs him 50p per cup to buy bio-degradable cups from the local cash and carry. Non bio-degradable cups cost between 20p and 30p from the same store.
				</p>

					In the last few months, customers have been asking him for snacks. He has decided to stock traybakes such as brownies and flapjacks that have been homemade and delivered on bicycle by a local supplier. These are packaged in paper bags. The equivalent shop-bought products are £1.00 more expensive than the ones that Stuart purchases.
				</p>
				<p id="p-7">
					Stuart also sells orange juice for those rare summer days in Edinburgh. He buys fresh oranges for 35p per orange. It takes him 5 minutes to squash and prepare 5 fresh oranges, which will make 1 cup of juice.
